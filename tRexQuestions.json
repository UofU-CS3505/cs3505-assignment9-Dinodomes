                        "fact": "The Tyrannosaurus rex, often abbreviated as T-rex, is one of the most well-known and formidable dinosaurs that roamed the Earth during the late Cretaceous period, about 68 to 66 million years ago. This apex predator was first discovered in 1902 by Barnum Brown, and since then, numerous specimens have been found across North America, enhancing our understanding of this gigantic creature. Standing at about 12 meters long and weighing up to 14 tons, the T-rex is distinguished by its massive skull, powerful jaw, and sharp teeth, some of which measured over 30 centimeters in length. Its strong hind legs supported its massive body, while its comparatively small arms, with just two fingers, remain a subject of scientific intrigue and debate. Research indicates that T-rex was likely both a predator and a scavenger, possessing an incredible sense of smell to locate carcasses over great distances. Recent studies using advanced imaging and biomechanical modeling suggest that T-rex could bite with a force of over 6,000 pounds per square inch, making it one of the most powerful bites in the animal kingdom. The T-rex continues to captivate both the scientific community and the public imagination, symbolizing the mystery and majesty of the age of dinosaurs."
