    "body": "Brontosaurus had a massive barrel-shaped ribcage that housed an enormous digestive system, necessary for fermenting and breaking down the vast quantities of vegetation it consumed daily.",
    "head": "The Brontosaurus' skull was relatively small compared to its huge body, with nostrils positioned at the top of the head. This placement has led some scientists to speculate about whether these dinosaurs might have been partly amphibious, using water to support their massive bodies.",
    "legs": "The legs of the Brontosaurus were incredibly robust and pillar-like, supporting its massive body. These legs also positioned directly under the body, which helped in bearing its enormous weight more efficiently than the sprawling legs of reptiles.",
    "tail": "The tail of the Brontosaurus was extremely long, whip-like, and may have been used as a defensive weapon or for communicative purposes, such as signaling to other members of its species."
